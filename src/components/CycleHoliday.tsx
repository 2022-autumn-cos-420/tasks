/*

-You will need one state, either a string or an enumeration of 5 strings like 
QuestionType (perhaps named Holiday).

-You will need to define two functions (or two Records) that can take in 
an existing holiday and produce the next holiday - one function should 
produce the next holiday alphabetically, and the other produces the next 
holiday in the year.

-The view should render the current holiday with the text 
Holiday: followed by the emoji (e.g., Holiday: 游꾺).

-The first button should include the text Alphabet somewhere 
(e.g., Advance by Alphabet) and changes the current holiday 
to the next one alphabetically.

-The second button should include the text Year somewhere 
(e.g., Advance by Year) and changes the current holiday to 
the next one in the year.
-For example, let us say we only had three holidays:

游꿆 to represent the Dragon Boat Festival in the summer
游꾺 to represent Halloween at the end of October
游뿞 to represent Diiwali earlier in October
Then the transitions in the year would be:

游꿆 -> 游뿞
游뿞 -> 游꾺
游꾺 -> 游꿆
And the transitions alphabetically would be:

游뿞 -> 游꿆
游꿆 -> 游꾺
游꾺 -> 游뿞

5 Christmas 游꾸 1
3 Halloween 游꾺 3
4 thanksgiving 游붂 5
1 St.Patricks day 驕떮잺 4
2 Easter 游낺 2
